# SAPlockbox


Hi Thinkers out there,

Soniya here, I am crazy about  SAP, so here is a documentation on SAP Lockbox which can be used for banking projects 
Lockboxs are special depository accounts set up at a bank to which customer remit their invoice payments. Banks daily than submit company's an electronic file listing all deposits and invoices that are paid against. Company's than upload these files in SAP and update their balance and clear customers i.e. A/R accounts
